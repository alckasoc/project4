              <p>This beginner Python project is perfect for testing for correct
                variable usage and concatenation. In Python, the variable usage
                only ever matters if it is paired with a different datatype. For
                example, one would need to include a str(int) if one wanted to
                integrate an integer into a string. This idea is basically concatenation.
                Other examples of converting variables include float() and int(). For this
                specific example, it requires the student to create a function with no
                parameter (and to call this function). Identifiable variable names are given
                in order to practice good habits. The input's refer to the named variables and
                in turn these variables are then concatenated with other pieces of string. The
                "\n" is meant to indicate a line break.

              <p>I implore you that you should understand class structures and it's concepts before
                exploring the rest of this explanation.
                Though originally this project was not intended to be
                designed with a class and objects, I nonetheless did it.
                To explain this version, I simply first created a class called
                Question. I then created a constructor (def __init__) with
                the parameters: self, prompt, answer. The self parameter is given
                by default. Like any conventional constructor, I set self.prompt = prompt
                and self.answer = answer. Afterwards, I created a list with a few strings that
                include the questions and the answer choices. To supply the program with answers
                to these questions, I created a second list that holds the an object that includes
                the question (i.e. question_prompts[0]) and the correct answer as a letter (i.e. "d").
                I then created a function called run_quiz(questions) which only takes one parameter
                "questions" whereas as of now, it is merely a variable to label the parameter. I created
                a variable called "score" and I set it to 0. Afterwards, I created a for loop that selects the
                items inside the list called "questions" where the items being selected are given the temporary
                variable called "question". The variable "answer" is set to the an input statement where
                the program prompts you with question.prompt which is basically a notation that python uses
                to access the attributes in an object. Notice that the for loop penetrates through the
                first layer of the "questions" list. so that the variable "question" represents the
                "Question(question_prompts[0], "d"...etc)". Then since "question" is set to each one
                of the list items in "questions", one can then use question.prompt in class notation
                to access the specific question listed in the other list: question_prompts. The if statement
                inside the for loop is meant to count the amount of times your inputted answer matches the
                question.answer which is the lowercase letter within "Question(question_prompts[0], "d")".
                If it does match, the score is increased by 1. After the for loop ends, I used simple string
                concatenation to display how many questions you answered correctly out of the total number of
                questions. Finally, I ran the function with the variabl "questions" to fill in as the parameter.

              <p>This simple program allows one to find all the factors
                of a number. I began with a function called factorials with a parameter
                of x. I then created an empty list called factor_list which we would append
                all the numbers that evenly divide into the inputted number. I created a
                for loop which sets the variable value to a number within the range of
                the inputted number + 1, to 0 (not including 0), and it decreases by 1 (hence the -1).
                I created an if statement inside the for loop that has a condition that if the inputted
                value (x) is evenly divided by the value within the specified range (hence the modulos %
                which calculates the remainder after division so if set to 0 it would be evenly divided), then
                it would set that evenly divided number to "y" and it would then be appended to the empty list
                called factor_list. After the for loop, the list would be printed out. Lastly, I
                called the function with an integer-based input that prompts the use to enter an integer number.
                This integer number would of course be passed into the function set to the variable "x".

              <p>This simple game is complicated in Python. I first had to import
                sys and random in order to generate some random choices from the computer.
                user1_answer is the input the player gets where they are prompted to choose
                rock, paper or scissors. I created another list that has 3 items that has the
                exact strings of "rock", "paper", and "scissors". user2_answer is the computer
                generated answer where I used the random module to randomly select a choice from
                the specified list. I then printed the user2_answer knowing full well that the
                player has already inputted his/her choice. I created a function that takes 2
                parameters: u1, and u2. I then began the tedious process of using the conditional
                if statement to figure out each possibility and return a string that tells who won.
                Lastly, I printed while calling the compare function with user1_answer and user2_answer

              <p>This simple reverse function takes no parameters and is merely just called.
                I created a variable string that refers to the user input string. I created
                an empty string to house the end product. Afterwards, I created a for loop
                where letter refers to the position of each letter in the inputted string.
                I subtracted 1 because the length counts all the letter starting from 1. It
                continues to -1 where it does not include -1 meaning it ends at the 0 value which
                is crucial when talking about counting in Python where most things begin at 0. The last
                -1 is meant to specify the intervals at which it decreases which is 1. Within the for loop,
                I appended the each letter of the inputted string into another_string however since the range
                goes from the last position to the first, it reverses the entire string. Lastly, I printed the
                reversed string.

              <p>Though this function does look complicated it is merely
                just a concoction of many variables and if statements. The
                random module is imported to provide a random number. The
                function play_agains is empty and is merely just called.
                I created the variable random_generated_number which
                converts a random number from the range 1 to 101 (not including 101)
                to an integer. I prepared a few variables like user_guess and guesses
                to initially have virtually nothing. I created a while loop that each time
                it loops it adds 1 to the guesses variable where it cannot surpass 7 meaning
                there are 7 attempts (guesses begins at 0). I printed the random_gemerated_number
                as to serve as a value to test if the program is running properly. I prompt the
                user for a guess between 1 and 100 and I set this variable to user_guess. I then
                continued with a set of conditional statements that prints out whether the person
                guessed too low, too high, or they got it right. After the statement, I included
                guesses_left to inform the user of how many guesses they have left. Outside of the
                for loop, I also included this to tell how many guesses the user had left at the end of the
                guessing game. I then created another simple if statement that asks the user if they want to play again.
                If the inputted answer to this conditional statement is "no", then it would end, if it was "yes",
                then it would call itself to repeat the entire process with a new randomly generated number.

              <p> This project is similar to the last where it involves guessing a number. However,
                this one involves the computer guessing the user's number which is never inputted in.
                This method is similar to binary searching where the computer continually divides the
                appropriate range in half until it narrows down to only your number. In the meantime, you
                give the computer clues by telling it if it is too high or too low in order to appropriately narrow
                down the range. In this project, the computer begins with guessing 50 and if it was told that it was too
                low, then it would set the start value to the guessed number (50). Whereas, if it was told that it was too
                high, then the end value would be set to computer number. This repeats until it either correctly guesses your number
                or the user fails to provide the computer with clues. I created another if statement where it tells the user whether
                the computer won or lost and if the user wants to play again, similar to the previous project.

              <p> Java is much more complicated in terms of syntax than Python. To begin with,
                the imports are jaw-dropping. One must use the extension, ".awt", to access java's
                package called Abstract Window Toolkit. It allows for a programmer to create images on
                a window. We begin by importing Color and Graphics. We then import Graphics2D, Rectangle, and the sub-extension ".geom"
                to access Ellipse2D and Line2D to create more specific ellipses and lines. Finally,
                for the imports, we import "javax.swing.JComponent".JComponent, in summary, is an abstract class
                that provides greater functionality like the ".awt" extension. The second image depicts the 2 classes
                needed for this project which are FaceComponent and FaceViewer. We begin with a normal public class
                called FaceComponent which <u>extends</u> the JComponent abstract class to provide extra functionality.
                We then include a method called paintComponent which is essential that it is typed exactly like this. It
                takes an object from the Graphics class and this variable is called g in this case. As the picture describes,
                we need to recover the Graphics2D. (Graphics2D) g must be typed this exact way whereas the "g2" can be anything
                because it is a variable. Next, we create a few new color combinations and store them in a variables greyPink and
                darkGreen which is self-explanatory. We then take g2 and set its color to pink which is one of many default colors.
                We create an ellipse next. Note that teh ".Double" extension is meant to give specified instructions as to the location
                of your drawn ellipse. This ellipse is stored in the variable called head1. Also note that the parameters within the
                parentheses specifies in this specific order: (x position, y position, width, length). After setting the color, when you
                draw the ellipse, it will only show that ellipse with an outlined color. To fix this problem, one can just simply do
                "g2.fill(head1);". This process is repeated for 2 more ellipses, then the mouth is created by using the Line2D.Double in the
                same sense where you specify (x start position, y start position, x end position, y end position). Lastly, one can finish with
                "g2.drawString();" to insert a message where the numbered arguments specify the position of where the string begins.
                <br><br>
                The second class includes the imported package called JFrame from ".swing". JFrame is basically a container that holds buttons,
                textfields, and whatnot to create a user interface. I created a new JFrame(); and gave it the variable name of "frame".
                The next few commands like ".setSize();" and ".setTitle();" set the size of the window by width and height and give the window a title.
                The ".setDefaultCloseOperator(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);" allows the user to specify a method to close the window. Then, the FaceComponent class
                is called and it is added via the ".add();" function to the JFrame. Lastly, the visibility is set to true to ensure that it is able to be seen.

              <p>This project focuses on the java.util.Scanner which allows for the user to input
                datatypes into the program. A standard class is created. We create a new Scanner by doing
                "Scanner anyVariableHere = new Scanner(System.in);". Afterwards, we print out something that prompts
                the user for an input. We follow this prompt with an anyVariableHere.nextdataType();. Then, this can be set
                to a variable in case the programmer wants to manipulate the user input. For example, ".nextInt();" specifies
                an expected integer, while ".nextLine();" specifies an expected String, and ".nextDouble();" specifies an expected
                double (otherwise a float in Python). We finally finish with printing format which is specified by "printf". The programmer
                can include %n where n can any specified format on the format page <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/java-string-format-examples">here</a>.
                Then, there is a comma followed by variables that correspond in order and in format to the %n's.

                However, to calculate the minimum, maximum, and the absolute value would require either more programming
                or a new package. The java.lang.Math package allows us to calculate the minimum, maxmimum, and absolute value.

              <p>This one is fairly standard with a scanner. However, this program requires a conditional statement
                that tests if the inputted number is evenly divisible by 2 or not to determine whether the number is even
                or odd. Like in Python, this can be done with the "%" sign.

              <p>This program, initially, looks like a mess and in a way, it is. To cover the
                general premise of this function, I encased the entire program in a while loop
                that continues to loop while the String "playAgain" is equal to "yes". At the end
                of the program, I have a set of conditional statements that asks the user if they want to play
                again which prompts them for a "yes or no" answer which decides if the while loop will loop once
                again. I created a variable that accessed the Random class and I generated a random number
                from 0 to 3 (not including 3). This number is then ran through a conditional statement which
                decides whether it is a rock (R), paper (P), or scissors (S). I then have another set of conditional
                statements to test all the possibilities and I had the system print out which side won. One important
                thing to note for this project is that, unlike Python, in Java one must do ".equals()" to test if
                a variable is equal to the given string.

            </div>
            <div class="javaexplanation">
              <p>This short practice describes 3 different types of loops.
                The first loop is a standard while loop that begins with the
                integer "i", and it increases at increments of 1 smybolized by
                the "i++" where when it reaches 4, the loop will stop running
                and printing our the current number. The second loop is
                similar except it begins with "do" and ends in while. In summary,
                this loop is going to execute the command at least once before
                checking the "while" condition. The last example is a standard loop where
                the for loop requires 3 statements: the first being defining the interval integer,
                the second being the condition, and the last being the increments at which it increases.

              <p> We begin by importing java.util.Scanner because we want the user to prompt for
                a certain number. After creating the standard classes, I created a nested for loop.
                Now, a nested for loop, loops through the outer loop once but it specifies how many times
                the inner loop loops through for each one loop of the outer loop. I prepared a variable
                called "i" and began at 1 because the default would be 0 instead. I created a condition so that
                "i" would go up to the inputted "number" variable. And for every one loop of the outer loop, the inner loop
                with a locally defined variable "j", will loop as many times up to the numerical value of the variable "i".
                And for each loop of the inner loop, it will print out "i". THus it will print out the a certain number
                with that number's number of iterations (designated on the same line by the "System.out.print" and the "System.out.println" outside of the inner
                loop but inside of the outer loop).

              <p>For this project, I began with 2 standard imports so I can prompt the user for an input
                and also apply some math functions. I prompted the user for an integer number and I
                stored it in a variable called "number". Then I prepared 3 integer variables for 3 separate
                while loops. Each while loop begins by looping through until it reaches the number - 1.
                Each while loop has an if statement to test each number to see if it is adequate for the
                condition whether the condition is if it's a perfect square, if it's divisible by 10, or
                if it's two to the power to a certain number while being under the variable "number" value.
                A few notable things include that (int) will check if the value is an integer and System.out.print
                will print things on the same line instead of System.out.println where it enters the next line after
                a print.

              <p> I began by importing the scanner like normal and ArrayList which will basically
                create a list like in Python. I prompted for the viewer to input a number to go up to
                and I created an empty array for integers. I looped from the beginningValue of 1 all the way
                up to the actual inputted number and appended each value that was a perfect factor to the
                empty array. I then created another loop that would loop through all the numbers in the
                list of factors except for the actual number itself and summed all of them up. I finished
                with an if statement that would gauge whether the inputted number would be a perfect, deficient,
                or an abundant number.
