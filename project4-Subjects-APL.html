              <p><b>Objectives:</b><br> There are four objectives
                to this packet: accurately understand rhetorical analysis prompts,
                to be able to determine BIG and LITTLE questions, to write
                an effective essay, and to appropriately organize your thoughts.
                <br><br><b>Prompt Interpretation:</b><br> The first step is to identify
                the title, author, and genre via the acronym T.A.G. The second
                step is to identify any relevant background information. The
                final step is to identify the BIG questions and LITTLE questions which should take the form
                of an interrogative sentence and an imperative sentence. BIG questions
                should focus on the bigger picture while the LITTLE question should be focused
                on following through with the prompt and writing an effective essay.
                <br><br><b>Quotation Format:</b><br> It is similar to a sandwich in which you begin with a claim,
                then textual evidence, and finally an explanation.
                <br><br><b>Rhetorical Triangle Terms:</b><br> Exigence is what prompts the speaker
                to speak at this particular point in time. Immediate audience is the audience currently
                listening or reading the piece. Mediated audience is the implicit audience where they
                don't directly receive the other end of the essay/speech etc. Purpose is what the speaker intends
                the reader to feel. Arrangement is the organization or structure. Form is the genre. Surface Features
                is the arrangement combined with diction, syntax, imagery, and figurative language.
                Qualifiers are words that limit the scope of a claim. <a href="https://www.cusd80.com/cms/lib/AZ01001175/Centricity/Domain/8219/jolliffes-rhetorical-framework1.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a>
                 is a link to a diagram.
                <br><br><b>Logos:</b><br> Logical appeal, otherwise known as logos, appears in the form of inductive (specific to general)/deductive reasoning
                (from general to specific), or by stating statistics, examples, facts, evidence, syllogism where it is
                a form of deductive reasoning where you can conclude a specific example from a broader example.
                A Warrant is an implied statement that creates a logical connection between a claim and a reason.
                <br><br><b>Ethos:</b><br> Ethos, otherwise known as credibility, appears in the form of ethics, morals, and understanding.
                <br><br><b>Pathos:</b><br> Pathos, otherwise known as emotional appeal, appears in the form of emotionally moving and heartfelt
                diction where it incites a certain feeling within you.
                <br><br><b>More Rhetorical Terms:</b><br> Alliteration is the rpeated use of a beginning letter.
                Anaphora is the repeated use of a phrase at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
                An anecdote is a personal account from one's life. Ad hominem is a logical fallacy
                that a writer attacks in an opponent. Expletive terms are words used to add emphasis that
                break the flow of a sentence or they could be profanity. Asyndeoton is the repeated omission
                of recurring conjunctions. An oxymoronic term is one that consists of 2 contradictory words.
                Personification is applying human-like characteristics on an inanimate object. Antithesis
                is a rhetorical strategy used to juxtapose contrasting ideas in a clause or sentence.
                Parallelism is the repeated use of a certain structure in a sentence. Non sequitur is
                where an argument's conclusion doesn't align with the rest of the piece. Hyperbole
                is an intense form of exaggeration. Polysyndeton is the repeated use of a conjunction.
                Enumeratio is a figure of amplification where a string of information is divided to add emphasis.
                A rhetorical question is a question that can be obviously answered and shouldn't be taken seriously.
                Diction is word choice. Syntax is the permutation of words. Imagery is syntax and diction combined
                to create a visually appealing picture. A paradox is a contradictory statement. A concession is
                the acknowledgement of another person's argument.

                <b>Possible Strategies</b><br>
                There are a great deal of combinations in which you can approach a multiple choice exam.
                You could begin by targetting the forest question or the root questions. However, root questions
                generally don't rely on information in the passage and should be ideally finished first. As you read,
                you should be taking notes, in the margins, of the general idea of the passage and make attempts to summarize
                each paragraph. As you read, you can answer tree questions or wait till the end to answer the rest of the questions
                knowing that you are on a time restrain. And for footnotes, make sure to understand that in  text, books, journals, and magazines
                are considered LONG works and are italicized or underlined whereas SHORT works like articles, essays, and chapters, are in quotation marks.
